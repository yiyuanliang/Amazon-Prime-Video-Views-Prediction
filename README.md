# Amazon-Prime-Video-Views-Prediction

In this project, we will buid a prediction model to predict whether a movie is going to perform well on Amazon Prime Movie platform. 

During this project, we will thinking about and try to figure out 3 main questions: 
          
 
    1. What type of model should we choose to predict the movie rating? 
    2. What are the driven factors that will affect the movie rating, and what insights can we get? 
    3. How can we improve a movie performance on Amazon Prime Movie platform? 

Following is the architecture of this project: 

    Part 1: Data Exploration 
                a. Understand the Raw Dataset
                b. Check Missing Values
                c. Check Duplicates
                d. Understand Numerical Features 
                        1. feature distribution
                        2. feature correaltion
                e. Understand Categorical Features
                        1. feature distribution
    
    Part 2: Data Preprocessing
                a. Convert Categorical Features
                b. Handle Missing Values 
                        1. fill by mean
                        2. fill by KNN Regressor
                c. Feature Scaling
    
    Part 3: Model Training & Evaluation(Cross Validation + Grid Search)
                a. Linear with Normal Equation
                b. Polynomial Regression
                c. Ridge
                d. Lasso
                e. Random Forest
    
    Part 4: Model Selection: Performaction Evaluation
                a. MSE Score
    
    Part 5: Feature Importance
                a. Random Forest
